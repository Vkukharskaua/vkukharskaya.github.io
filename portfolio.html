          <h3>Victor E. Eagle</h3>
          In 1973, Eastern’s mascot became the Eagles. Shortly before that, the university’s board of trustees declared the “Savages” (the school’s mascot since 1923) unacceptable. Eagles are native to eastern Washington so it was a logical choice for a replacement.
          The new mascot was originally known as Victor E. Eagle.</figcaption>

          <h3>Dance Off</h3>
          At the 2010 National Championship Football game in Frisco, Texas, Swoop’s rendition of the Dougie squashed Delaware’s Blue Hen in the pregame dance competition. The YouTube video, Swoop versus Youdee (final dance off, January ‘11), has more than 25,600
          views!</figcaption>

            <h3>Official</h3>
          In the fall of 1999, the caricature of Swoop was given a single official look as opposed to 25 versions seen during the 1990s. Standards were developed with input from alumni, students, faculty and staff to establish an official design for the mascot.</figcaption>

          <h3>Chicken Hawk</h3>
          In 2005, the eagle design was once again updated. Throughout the years, Swoop has had some work done. He looks more eagle-like and less chicken hawk-like. He appears much friendlier, too. Wherever he goes, Swoop now has a smile on his beak.</figcaption>

          <h3>Ambassador</h3>
          Swoop, the mascot for Eastern Washington University, is an ambassador and spirit leader for the university. His charming, high-spirited personality, entertaining dance moves and crazy antics have made him America’s Favorite Mascot. He’s immensely
          popular among children, EWU fans, alumni and students.</figcaption>
